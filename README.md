# jawb
A Java port of AutoWikiBrowser.

I made this because I was tired of messing with Wine configuration to get AWB to run on Linux.

## Building and running
    mvn package
After the build is done, you'll want to go to the target folder and run the JAR file with `-with-dependencies` in its name, not the other JAR file.
